# CS4RI Project Home
This project aims to help Rhode Island middle and high schoolers learn the basic logic flow of simple development (loops, conditionals, variables, functions) through an interactive environmental scenario.

The student are presented with a list of environmental variables and algorithms to "program" into the system using blockly.  The idea is not only for the student to understand the logic and flow of the code, but to use critical thinking to determine which variables are most appropriate to use

Data from Hurricane Sandy was used to train the four algorithms selected: 
- Linear Regression
- Neural Network
- Support Vector Machine
- Random Forest
